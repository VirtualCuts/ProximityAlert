# ProximityAlert
Extract assets.zip into the compiled output folder.
Mostly customisable through the .txt files but some things are hard coded because I'm too lazy to clean them up.

# Includes
**Mod Warnings:** sounds and indicators for corrupted blood etc..

**Path Warnings:** chests, strongboxes, sulphite, special mobs, etc.

**Basic Sirus Helper:** it draws a big ass line to him in case you too are bad at video games.
